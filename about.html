        <h1>About Pregnancy Planning Flip</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the <strong>Pregnancy Planning Flip</strong> tool! This tool is designed to assist couples in making decisions regarding pregnancy using a simulated coin flip mechanism. Here’s how it works:</p>
        
        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Input Choices:</strong> Users input the number of attempts (must be an odd number) for the simulated coin flip.</li>
            <li><strong>Simulated Coin Flips:</strong> The tool uses multiple methods to simulate a coin flip, including basic randomness, weighted choices, and aggregated results to ensure fair and balanced outcomes.</li>
            <li><strong>Generate Results:</strong> Based on the number of attempts, the tool performs a series of flips and determines the result by evaluating the most frequent outcome.</li>
            <li><strong>Display Results:</strong> The result of the coin flip is shown along with a summary of the attempts, matches, and mismatches.</li>
            <li><strong>Pregnancy Suggestion:</strong> The tool suggests whether it might be a good time for pregnancy based on whether the number of matches (where user choices align with the coin flip result) exceeds mismatches.</li>
            <li><strong>Visual Representation:</strong> A pie chart displays the distribution of Heads vs. Tails across all attempts for easy visual analysis.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Why Use This Tool?</h2>
        <p>This tool provides an interactive and fun way to assist in decision-making. By using randomness in a controlled manner, it offers an engaging approach to exploring choices and understanding probabilities. It’s a great way for couples to make light-hearted decisions and gain insights into the timing of pregnancy planning.</p>
