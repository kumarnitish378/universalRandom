### **Project Presentation: Pregnancy Planning Flip**

---

****Project Name:** Pregnancy Planning Flip**

**Objective:**  
The Pregnancy Planning Flip is a fun and interactive tool designed to aid couples in their pregnancy planning process using a coin-flip simulation. This project combines randomness and user interaction to provide a unique experience in decision-making.

---

****Key Features:**

1. **Randomized Coin Flip Simulation:**
   - Uses multiple randomization methods (basic choice, sum of random bits, weighted randomness, and odd/even numbers) to simulate a coin flip.
   - Ensures high unpredictability with nested iterations for added complexity.

2. **User Profiles:**
   - Allows users to create and manage profiles to track their choices, results, and points.
   - Facilitates personalized tracking and statistics.

3. **Multiple Choices:**
   - Users can make multiple choices in a single session. The system requires an odd number of attempts for balanced outcomes.
   - Automatically generates choices and compares them to the simulated result.

4. **Detailed Summary:**
   - Provides a summary of the results after all attempts, including the total number of attempts, matches, and mismatches.
   - Shows detailed feedback for each attempt, indicating whether the choice was correct or incorrect.

5. **Historical Tracking:**
   - Keeps a record of past choices and results for each user profile.
   - Displays match percentages and historical data for better insights.

6. **Future Enhancements:**
   - Includes placeholders for features like setting reminders, customizing coin options, and adding graphical enhancements.
   - Planned expansion to integrate more interactive elements and user customization.

****User Experience:**

1. **Interactive Interface:**
   - Users are guided through the process of making choices and receiving results in a clear and engaging manner.

2. **Feedback and Statistics:**
   - Immediate feedback on each choice with a final summary that highlights overall performance and statistics.

3. **Profile Management:**
   - Easy creation and selection of user profiles to personalize the experience.

---

****Technical Implementation:**

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Randomization Methods:** Combination of basic random choice, weighted options, and nested iterations.
- **Data Management:** Tracking of user profiles and historical results.

****Conclusion:**

Pregnancy Planning Flip is designed to offer a playful and insightful tool for couples in their planning journey. It combines randomness with user interaction to create a unique experience, while also providing useful tracking and feedback features. Future updates will enhance its functionality and user engagement.
